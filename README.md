# Enzyme-Thermostability-Prediction
Proteins which are also known as enzymes serve as catalysts in the chemical processes that take place within living things. 
The purpose of this implementation is to estimate the thermostability of enzyme variations.
Natural sequences and manufactured sequences with one or more mutations on them are included in the experimentally observed thermostability (melting temperature) data.
Protein stability is a crucial topic in biotechnology that must be understood and precisely predicted.
Enzyme engineering can be used to address issues like sustainability, carbon neutrality, and other global difficulties. 
Improvements in enzyme stability might reduce expenses and speed up the rate at which scientists can iterate on notions.
The development of a model to predict/rank the thermostability of enzyme variants based on experimental melting temperature data.
Recently, many machine learning methods were proposed to predict the stability, impact of mutations on protein based on the pattern of variation in natural sequences and their three dimensional structures.
However, accurate prediction of protein thermal stability remains a great challenge. 
The purpose of the work is to have significant impact by balancing good nutrition for our human life and for our society, while spearheading environmental and social change.
